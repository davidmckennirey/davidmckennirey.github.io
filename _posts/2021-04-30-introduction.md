Welcome to my blog! 

```python
def welcome():
  print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
  welcome()
```

I'm creating this blog for two reasons - accountability and note-taking. I am currently scheduled to take my 1st OSCP attempt in around a month, and I plan on going through TJNull's excellent [list of OSCP-like HackTheBox machines][htb-list] as practice.

But practice doesn't mean anything if you don't actually *learn* anything, and I have a bad habit of forgetting everything I learned as soon as I root a box. So I have decided that I will be posting a write-up to this blog for every box that root. This way I have to really force myself to really understand how I got that root shell, and keep that information in my head long enough to write a blog post about it. It will also provide a convient reference if I find myself in a similar situation again in the future. 

Another bad habit of mine is also starting really hot out the gate on a personal project, and then falling off after a week and losing steam. You just need to take one look at my graveyard of half-finished private github repos to see pattern. So why will this time be different? Because I am doing it all publicly! Nothing motivates me quite like the fear of looking bad in public, so by publicly posting about my intentions I now have the fear of public shame to motiviate me.

So, I plan on posting at least 5 HTB write ups a week starting next week and going until my first exam attempt. Depending on the results of that attempt you may see more HTB write-ups (if I fail) or I will start posting other security related stuff (if I pass) but much less frequently. Or maybe I'll just keep posting HTB write-ups, who knows :shrug:
