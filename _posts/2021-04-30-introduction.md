Welcome to my blog!

```python
def welcome():
  print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
  welcome()
```

I'm creating this blog for two reasons - note-taking and accountability. I am currently scheduled to take my 1st OSCP attempt in around a month, and I plan on going through TJNull's excellent [list of OSCP-like HackTheBox machines][htb-list] as practice.

But practice doesn't mean anything if you don't actually *learn* anything, and I have a bad habit of forgetting everything I learned as soon as I root a box. So I have decided that I will be posting a write-up for every box that I root. This way, I have to force myself to *actually remember* how I got that root shell for at least as long as it takes to write a blog post about it. This blog can also serve as a sort-of public reference if I ever end up in a similar situation.

Another bad habit of mine is horribly pacing myself on personal projects. I start hot out the gate, ready to spend every waking moment on the project, but then end up loosing steam and falling off after a few weeks. You just need to take one look at my graveyard of half-finished private github repos to see the pattern repeating itself. So why will this time be different? Because I am doing it all publicly! Nothing terrifies me quite like the fear of public shame, so by publicly posting about my intentions I now have that to motiviate me.

So, I plan on posting at least 5 HTB write-ups a week starting next week and going until my first exam attempt. Depending on the results of that attempt you may see more HTB write-ups (if I fail) or I will start posting other security related stuff (if I pass) but much less frequently. Or maybe I'll just keep posting HTB write-ups, who knows :shrug:
